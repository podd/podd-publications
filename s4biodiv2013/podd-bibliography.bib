  abstract = {Presently, there are numerous bioinformatics databases available on
	different websites. Although RDF was proposed as a standard format
	for the web, these databases are still available in various formats.
	With the increasing popularity of the semantic web technologies and
	the ever growing number of databases in bioinformatics, there is
	a pressing need to develop mashup systems to help the process of
	bioinformatics knowledge integration. Bio2RDF is such a system, built
	from rdfizer programs written in JSP, the Sesame open source triplestore
	technology and an OWL ontology. With Bio2RDF, documents from public
	bioinformatics databases such as Kegg, PDB, MGI, HGNC and several
	of NCBI’s databases can now be made available in RDF format through
	a unique URL in the form of http://bio2rdf.org/namespace:id. The
	Bio2RDF project has successfully applied the semantic web technology
	to publicly available databases by creating a knowledge space of
	RDF documents linked together with normalized URIs and sharing a
	common ontology. Bio2RDF is based on a three-step approach to build
	mashups of bioinformatics data. The present article details this
	new approach and illustrates the building of a mashup used to explore
	the implication of four transcription factor genes in Parkinson’s
	disease. The Bio2RDF repository can be queried at http://bio2rdf.org.},

	Institute for Scientific and Technical Information (INIST), the Technical
	Information Center of Denmark, Canada Institute for Scientific and
	Technical Information (CISTI) the Australien National Data Service
	(ANDS) and the Dutch TU Delft Library all signed a Memorandum of
	Understanding to improve access to research data on the internet.
	The goal of this cooperation is to establish a not-for-profit agency
	called DataCite that enables organisations to register research datasets
	and assign persistent identifiers to them, so that research datasets
	can be handled as independent, citable, unique scientific objects.},
