  abstract = {The Plant Ontology Consortium (POC, http://www.plantontology.org)
	is a collaborative effort among model plant genome databases and
	plant researchers that aims to create, maintain and facilitate the
	use of a controlled vocabulary (ontology) for plants. The ontology
	allows users to ascribe attributes of plant structure (anatomy and
	morphology) and developmental stages to data types, such as genes
	and phenotypes, to provide a semantic framework to make meaningful
	cross-species and database comparisons. The POC builds upon groundbreaking
	work by the Gene Ontology Consortium (GOC) by adopting and extending
	the GOC's principles, existing software and database structure. Over
	the past year, POC has added hundreds of ontology terms to associate
	with thousands of genes and gene products from Arabidopsis, rice
	and maize, which are available through a newly updated web-based
	browser (http://www.plantontology.org/amigo/go.cgi) for viewing,
	searching and querying. The Consortium has also implemented new functionalities
	to facilitate the application of PO in genomic research and updated
	the website to keep the contents current. In this report, we present
	a brief description of resources available from the website, changes
	to the interfaces, data updates, community activities and future
	enhancement.},

  title = {{Bio2RDF}: Towards a mashup to build bioinformatics knowledge systems},
  journal = {Journal of Biomedical Informatics},
  year = {2008},
  volume = {41},
  pages = {706--716},
  number = {5},
  abstract = {Presently, there are numerous bioinformatics databases available on
	different websites. Although RDF was proposed as a standard format
	for the web, these databases are still available in various formats.
	With the increasing popularity of the semantic web technologies and
	the ever growing number of databases in bioinformatics, there is
	a pressing need to develop mashup systems to help the process of
	bioinformatics knowledge integration. Bio2RDF is such a system, built
	from rdfizer programs written in JSP, the Sesame open source triplestore
	technology and an OWL ontology. With Bio2RDF, documents from public
	bioinformatics databases such as Kegg, PDB, MGI, HGNC and several
	of NCBI’s databases can now be made available in RDF format through
	a unique URL in the form of http://bio2rdf.org/namespace:id. The
	Bio2RDF project has successfully applied the semantic web technology
	to publicly available databases by creating a knowledge space of
	RDF documents linked together with normalized URIs and sharing a
	common ontology. Bio2RDF is based on a three-step approach to build
	mashups of bioinformatics data. The present article details this
	new approach and illustrates the building of a mashup used to explore
	the implication of four transcription factor genes in Parkinson’s
	disease. The Bio2RDF repository can be queried at http://bio2rdf.org.},
