	is a collaborative effort among model plant genome databases and
	plant researchers that aims to create, maintain and facilitate the

	allows users to ascribe attributes of plant structure (anatomy and
	morphology) and developmental stages to data types, such as genes
	and phenotypes, to provide a semantic framework to make meaningful
	cross-species and database comparisons. The POC builds upon groundbreaking
	work by the Gene Ontology Consortium (GOC) by adopting and extending
	the GOC's principles, existing software and database structure. Over
	the past year, POC has added hundreds of ontology terms to associate
	with thousands of genes and gene products from Arabidopsis, rice
	and maize, which are available through a newly updated web-based
	browser (http://www.plantontology.org/amigo/go.cgi) for viewing,
	searching and querying. The Consortium has also implemented new functionalities
	to facilitate the application of PO in genomic research and updated

  title = {{Bio2RDF}: Towards a mashup to build bioinformatics knowledge systems},
  journal = {Journal of Biomedical Informatics},
  year = {2008},
  volume = {41},
  pages = {706--716},
  number = {5},
  abstract = {Presently, there are numerous bioinformatics databases available on
	different websites. Although RDF was proposed as a standard format
	for the web, these databases are still available in various formats.
	With the increasing popularity of the semantic web technologies and
	the ever growing number of databases in bioinformatics, there is
	a pressing need to develop mashup systems to help the process of
	bioinformatics knowledge integration. Bio2RDF is such a system, built
	from rdfizer programs written in JSP, the Sesame open source triplestore
	technology and an OWL ontology. With Bio2RDF, documents from public
	bioinformatics databases such as Kegg, PDB, MGI, HGNC and several
	of NCBI’s databases can now be made available in RDF format through
	a unique URL in the form of http://bio2rdf.org/namespace:id. The
	Bio2RDF project has successfully applied the semantic web technology
	to publicly available databases by creating a knowledge space of
	RDF documents linked together with normalized URIs and sharing a
	common ontology. Bio2RDF is based on a three-step approach to build
	mashups of bioinformatics data. The present article details this
	new approach and illustrates the building of a mashup used to explore
	the implication of four transcription factor genes in Parkinson’s
	disease. The Bio2RDF repository can be queried at http://bio2rdf.org.},

ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND:In recent years, imaging based, automated, non-invasive, and non-destructive high-throughput plant phenotyping platforms have become popular tools for plant biology, underpinning the field of plant phenomics. Such platforms acquire and record large amounts of raw data that must be accurately and robustly calibrated, reconstructed, and analysed, requiring the development of sophisticated image understanding and quantification algorithms. The raw data can be processed in different ways, and the past few years have seen the emergence of two main approaches: 2D image processing and 3D mesh processing algorithms. Direct image quantification methods (usually 2D) dominate the current literature due to comparative simplicity. However, 3D mesh analysis provides the tremendous potential to accurately estimate specific morphological features cross-sectionally and monitor them over-time.RESULT:In this paper, we present a novel 3D mesh based technique developed for temporal high-throughput plant phenomics and perform initial tests for the analysis of Gossypium hirsutum vegetative growth. Based on plant meshes previously reconstructed from multi-view images, the methodology involves several stages, including morphological mesh segmentation, phenotypic parameters estimation, and plant organs tracking over time. The initial study focuses on presenting and validating the accuracy of the methodology on dicotyledons such as cotton but we believe the approach will be more broadly applicable. This study involved applying our technique to a set of six Gossypium hirsutum (cotton) plants studied over four time-points. Manual measurements, performed for each plant at every time-point, were used to assess the accuracy of our pipeline and quantify the error on the morphological parameters estimated.CONCLUSION:By directly comparing our automated mesh based quantitative data with manual measurements of individual stem height, leaf width and leaf length, we obtained the mean absolute errors of 9.34%, 5.75%, 8.78%, and correlation coefficients 0.88, 0.96, and 0.95 respectively. The temporal matching of leaves was accurate in 95% of the cases and the average execution time required to analyse a plant over four time-points was 4.9 minutes. The mesh processing based methodology is thus considered suitable for quantitative 4D monitoring of plant phenotypic features.},
