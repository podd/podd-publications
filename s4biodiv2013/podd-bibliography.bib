  abstract = {Since 2005, the German National Library of Science and Technology
	(TIB) has offered a successful Digital Object Identifier (DOI) registration
	service for persistent identification of research data. In 2009,
	TIB, the British Library, the Library of the ETH Zurich, the French
	Institute for Scientific and Technical Information (INIST), the Technical
	Information Center of Denmark, Canada Institute for Scientific and
	Technical Information (CISTI) the Australien National Data Service
	(ANDS) and the Dutch TU Delft Library all signed a Memorandum of
	Understanding to improve access to research data on the internet.
	The goal of this cooperation is to establish a not-for-profit agency
	called DataCite that enables organisations to register research datasets
	and assign persistent identifiers to them, so that research datasets
	can be handled as independent, citable, unique scientific objects.},
