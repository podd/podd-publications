Database Management Tradeoffs
PODD Object Model
PODD Data Management
Quality
Semantic and structural
Both correct and complete
Flexibility
Controlled, optional migration of data
Based on OWL Version IRIs and OWL Imports
Performance
Scales by OWL performance for updating
Scales by SPARQL performance for querying
PODD Workflow
PODD Events
Event created in PODD for each set of images from a platform
Pots linked to images using events
Pots currently linked to:
Genus, species, and wild type
Planting date
Pots will be linked to more events in future:
Watering
Client reviews
Conclusion
Overall goal to allow for federated SPARQL queries across PODD instances to reuse existing plant phenomics data whereever possible
Already implemented, but datasets are small so far
Flexible integration of all project management data for a research group in a single PODD instance using the most relevant schema ontologies in each project
Similar SPARQL queries across all artifacts, regardless of the schema ontologies they are currently using
Results would be limited of course by the practicality of the query for the particular schema ontologies in use
